- Introduced XFree86-DGA 2.0 support (-dga and -dnz 
  'xifrac' options).   Removed difrac as a rudiment.
  Adapted manuals.
- Cleaned configuration script. 

Version 1.1.2 (16-Dec-2000) 365.8K

Version 1.1.1 (03-Dec-2000) 362.4K
----------------------------------
- Optimised drawing by storing a half-filled board.
- Revised the structure of background play list: added
  'ext' sections instead of 'apps', made options music
  player-specific. Changed the use of defaults.
  Introduced 'stop' option (resume music for the place
  where it was stopped), documented 'pause' line and
  added 'priority' line.
- Reduced the size of package by finding a way to link
  with libXxf86dga.a and libXxf86vm.a instead of keeping
  their source codes.
- Fixed some minor bugs in source and added difrac to RPM
  binary package (sorry, I had to do that with 1.1.0).
- Received a message from Per Bergland and happily
  removed phrase "where are you, guys?" in introduction.
- Started implementing support for xf86dga 2.0, as difrac
  no longer works with some video drivers. Most probably
  this will be the last version to support xf86dga 1.3
  The interfaces are completely different, and I can't
  longer provide backward compatibility.
- New 'a la artistique' license.
